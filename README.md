# PSR-7 Serializer üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This package provides functionality to persist [PSR-7] HTTP Responses based on and [PSR-17].

This package is designed to serialize within the PSR-7 standard. The data does not have the pre-serialized class name, so the restored class depends only on the PSR-17 Factory object passed to `unserializePsr7()`.

## Install

```
# minimum requirements when your project already has any HTTP library installed
composer require hakone/psr7-serializer

# for auto-detecting HTTP libraries installed in your project
composer require hakone/psr7-serializer php-http/discovery
```

[HTTPlug Discovery (`php-http/discovery`)][php-http/discovery] is a package useful for auto-discovering classes provided by installed HTTP libraries.

If you haven't installed any HTTP factory implementations yet: consider installing one of [`nyholm/psr7`][nyholm/psr7], [`guzzlehttp/psr7`][guzzlehttp/psr7], or [`laminas/laminas-diactoros`][laminas/laminas-diactoros].

## Usage

```php
<?php

use Http\Discovery\Psr17FactoryDiscovery;
use Http\Discovery\Psr18ClientDiscovery;
use function Hakone\Psr7Serializer\serializePsr7;
use function Hakone\Psr7Serializer\unserializeResponse;

// 1. Send HTTP Request
$http_client = Psr18ClientDiscovery::find();
$response = $client->sendRequest(
    Psr17FactoryDiscovery::findRequestFactory()
        ->createRequest('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/get?foo=bar')
);

// 2. Serialize and cache HTTP response
$serialized_data = serializePsr7($serializer->serializeResponse($response));
file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/cache.txt', $serialized_data);

// 3. Load and unserialize HTTP response
$loaded_serialized_data = file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/cache.txt');
$unserialized_response = unserializePsr7($loaded_serialized_data);
```

If you don't have HTTPlug Discovery installed, you must explicitly pass an instance of HTTP Factory to unserialize HTTP messages:

```php
use Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory;

$psr17Factory = new Psr17Factory();
$unserialized_response = unserializePsr7($loaded_serialized_data, $psr17Factory, $psr17Factory);
```

```php
use Laminas\Diactoros\{ResponseFactory, StreamFactory};

$unserialized_response = unserializePsr7($loaded_serialized_data, new ResponseFactory(), new StreamFactory());
```
